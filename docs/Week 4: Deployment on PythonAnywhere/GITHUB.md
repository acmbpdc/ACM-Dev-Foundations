![Git and Github](../assets/git-github.jpg)
Git is a super powerful version control system. 

It's essential for managing and tracking changes in code or files, especially when collaborating with a team. 

With Git, developers can work on multiple features simultaneously, track changes, and avoid conflicts.

## Whatâ€™s the Point?

In our case, git provides an easy and organized way to access and manage our code for deployment.

It ensures that we have the latest version of the code across all devices and environments.

## Key Benefits:
1. **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.

2. **Version History:** Every change is tracked, making it easy to roll back to previous versions if needed.

3. **Branching:** Create different versions of your project for features, testing, or bug fixes.

4. **Deployment:** Easily pull the latest version of your code for deploying to production.
